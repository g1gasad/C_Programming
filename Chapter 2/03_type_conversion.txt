In Programming, type compatibility is crucial.

For int a = 3.5;
The floating point number 3.5 will be demoted to 3, losing the fractional part
because the value stored in a should be an integer.

Conversly,
For float a = 3;
The integer number 3 will be promoted to 3.0

Operator Precedence:
1. *, /, %
2. +, -
3. =

Operator Associativity
